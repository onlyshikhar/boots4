                <p>It was double snub for the Congress from the Supreme Court on Thursday. A three-judge bench of the court not only rejected the party's plea to stay the Rajya Sabha elections in Gujarat scheduled for August 8 or the use of 'None of the Above' (NOTA) vote, but also embarrassed it by asking if it was apprehensive of losing. There was further dig at the grand old party when the bench headed by justice Dipak Misra asked Congress leaders and senior lawyers Kapil Sibal and Abhishek M Singhvi, who represented the party, if they did not challenge NOTA introduced in 2015 till now because it was suiting them. The bench questioned Sibal why he approached the court on the eve of the election when NOTA had come into existence two years ago.</p>
